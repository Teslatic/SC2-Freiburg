# Star-Craft-2-Project-Freiburg
This is a project supervised by the chair of neurorobotics at the University of Freiburg. We want to do a project with the Deepmind PYSC2 environment and intend to replicate and to improve the agent's performance by implementing our own ideas into the framework.


## Roadmap
- [x] Read & Understand the paper
- [x] Gather first hands on experience with PYSC2
  - [x] play a game as human
  - [x] load random agent
  - [x] watch a replay
  - [x] watch a replay in rendered version (currently only works on windows, regular SC2 game required)
- [x] Write first rule based agent as a simple tutorial (refer to link below)
- [ ] Replicate Minigame Results from the paper with the same or with own architectures
- [ ] Test own simple agent on full game
- [ ] Find a promising approach for our own implementation, i.e. which Algorithm, Network Structures etc.
- [x] Test own implementation on Minigames
- [ ] Create additional minigames
- [ ] Test on new minigames
- [ ] Test on full game
- [x] Document our findings
